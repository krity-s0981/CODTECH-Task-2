# Objective:
The primary objective of the Grade Management System program is to provide an easy-to-use solution for tracking and managing student grades. 
Overall, the program's objective is to serve as a simple, efficient and reliable tool for managing academic performance, supporting better academic planning and progress tracking.

#  Key activities of Grade Management System:

**Simplify Grade Management:** <br/>
Allow users (teachers, students or administrators) to quickly input and store grades for different subjects or assignments.

**Automate Grade Calculations:** <br/>
Automatically compute the average grade based on the grades entered, saving time and reducing manual errors.

**Provide Instant Feedback on Performance:** <br/>
Instantly convert the average grade into a letter grade (A, B, C, etc.) based on standard academic grading scales.
Calculate and display the corresponding GPA (Grade Point Average) on a 4.0 scale, giving users a quick measure of overall academic performance.

**User-Friendly Grade Display:** <br/>
Present a clear and concise summary of all entered grades, along with the calculated average, letter grade and GPA to provide a comprehensive overview of the student's performance.

**Promote Better Decision Making:** <br/>
By providing accurate grade tracking and performance summaries, the program helps users (students, teachers or academic advisors) make informed 
decisions regarding academic progress, intervention or areas of improvement.

# Technologies and Libraries Used
**Python:** <br/>
Python 3.x: The program is written in Python, a high-level programming language that is simple, readable and widely used for scripting, automation and building applications.
Pythonâ€™s built-in data structures and control flow mechanisms are used to manage the grade data, perform calculations and provide user interaction.

**Libraries** <br/>
Built-in Python Libraries: No external libraries are required for this program, as it relies entirely on Python's standard libraries and features.

# Key Concepts
**1. Variables and Data Types:** <br/>
Variables store the input values and Data Types are used for storing numerical grades and str is used for subject names.

**2. Conditionals (If-Else Statements):** <br/>
The program uses conditional statements to validate user input. Determine the letter grade based on the average score.
Assign a corresponding GPA value.

**3. Loops** <br/>
The main loop (while True) keeps the program running until the user chooses to exit.
Loops also handle continuous input, allowing users to repeatedly add grades or display the summary.

**4. Functions:** <br/>
The program is modularized using functions which handle specific tasks.

**5. Class and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** <br/>
The program uses a class to encapsulate the data and behavior for managing student grades.
Object-Oriented Programming helps in organizing the code logically by grouping related functionality into a single class.

**6. Dictionaries:** <br/>
A dictionary is used to store subjects and their corresponding grades.
This allows for easy management of grades for different subjects.

**7. User Input and Output:** <br/>
Input: The program collects user input via the input() function.<br/>
Output: Results are displayed using the print() function.

**8. Data Validation:** <br/>
User input is validated to ensure the entered grades are between 0 and 100. If the input is outside this range, an error message is displayed and the user is prompted to enter a valid grade.

**9. Modularity and Code Reusability:** <br/>
The program is designed in a modular way, where each functionality is separated into different methods, making the code easy to maintain and reuse.
